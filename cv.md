## Professional Summary

A results-oriented Web Developer with over a decade of experience in designing, developing, and deploying robust web applications. My career began with a strong foundation in PHP-based backend development (Yii, Laravel, Bitrix), evolving into specialized expertise within the SAP ecosystem. This includes extensive experience with SAPUI5/Fiori frontend development and, for the past 2.5+ years, a primary focus on full-stack SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) solutions leveraging Node.js and the CAP Framework. I have a proven track record of successfully leading development teams, managing project lifecycles, and delivering high-impact solutions for enterprise clients in retail and ERP sectors. I am actively seeking to integrate modern frontend frameworks such as React, Vue, or Svelte (ideally with Server-Side Rendering) into my skillset, complementing my strong SAP BTP backend expertise.
