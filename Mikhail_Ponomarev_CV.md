## Professional Summary

I have more then 10 years of experience in SAP BTP Development, both frontend and backend. In most of them in the recent 5 years - with particular or full team-lead responsibilities. Plus, before entering SAP area I've been working about 4 years as a general Web Developer and still continiously keep tracking the state of technologies in this area.

### I'm outstanding at
- Applying up-to-date code best practices - both SAP and non-SAP
- Providing clean, easily supportable, testable and extendable code
- Being a team player - I can take a required role in a team depending on current requirements, such as team lead who brings practices, delegates and reviews tasks; or casual performer who follows defined rules and focus on quantity; or firefighter whos focus is on most complex and unclear features
- Adoption to existing code base and practices, ability to improve it with a sequence of a small steps

### I admit I have a room to improvement at
- Pipelines setup - I can work with exising ones, sometimes even add or edit steps, but not set it up from scratch
- Non-SAP Web-development technologies - even though I'm trying to track it continiously, the amount of practice is not enough to shine here
- Creating and supporing multi-tenant applications - I only worked with such one once, and didn't participate in a configuring the basement
- SAP BTP Integration - didn't have a chance to work with S/4 API Business Hub or CPI
